CPSC 481 Project
T10 Group 2 

In order to run our application you can dowload the following repository as a zip and open the html files locally, for some image requests you may require a live server. We have been using the "Live Server" Extension on VS Code

Alternatively, the application is currently live here: https://anaperrone.github.io/CPSC-481-Group-Project/
